<dl><dt><b>Dear Friend,</b></dt>
<dd><p>How the hell are you doing?...Huh..,</p>
<p>It's just everything seems so dull and boring without you.I miss our 
olden days when we used to have so much fun and the smile on our faces
were a never ending saga.</p>
<p>The days of joy has become the days of empitiness .
The plans we made are just remainded in our memories now.
There were few night's where I just think of our past days and the smile
on my lips just grows with every thought of our past.Whenever I think about
that,we made distanced ourselves at some point and rebounded again was
something which make me laugh at how silly we were back then.But now
the things have been changed the seat beside me where you always sit
is occupied by someother people.The place where I was surrounded by you
has changed by someone else now.The benche's in which we have 
scribbled our feelings has now became unfamiliar.The mornings,where I
used to getup and ready to meet you,...Now the hope in me is varnished.
<p>Do you miss me,like I do you?</p>
